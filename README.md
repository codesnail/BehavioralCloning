# Behavioral Cloning Project

---

The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model to keep a car on a lane, based on demonstrated driving behavior (steering angles) and a video stream of road as seen from a camera mounted on the car.

Some of the high-level objectives of this project are:
* Use the Udacity simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track One in the simulator without leaving the road

#### Files Submitted

The project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results

#### How to simulate 
Using the Udacity provided simulator, drive.py and my model file model.h5
